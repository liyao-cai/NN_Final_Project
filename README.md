# Final Project Description

The goal of this project is to use three models to classify the textual sentiment of IMDB comments. Sentiments are divided into positive and negative. In addition, the three models used in this project include LSTM, RNN and transformer. We will also compare the results produced by the three models and explain their differences.

Dataï¼š
The data used in this project is the IMDB data that comes with the Keras library, which contains a total of 50,000 comments and annotates their labels(from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb).
